This week's project requires us to implement a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and a Naive Bayes classifier. Once we conduct the experiments, we will calculate the resulting metrics: Experimental Procedure: Download the two datasets from the given links: Dataset 1 Source: [Train Dataset Source: Link (Links to an external site.), Test Dataset Source: Link (Links to an external site.)] Dataset 2 Source: [Link (Links to an external site.)] Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20 sets. For dataset 1, because we don't have the label for the test set, we will use the train set to create train and test data (i.e. splitting further), then perform K-nearest neighbor classification.
For dataset 2, I performed classification of the testing set samples using the Naive Bayes Classifier. Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification). Report the confusion matrix of each classifier. In this project we were determined to use certain variables to predict whether a sent email was spam or not
